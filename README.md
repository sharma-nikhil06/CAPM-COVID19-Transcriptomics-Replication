# COVID-19-Associated Pulmonary Mucormycosis (CAPM) Transcriptomic Analysis Replication Study

## Project Overview

This repository contains the data and analysis for a replication study of the original research on COVID-19-associated pulmonary mucormycosis (CAPM), as published in the Mycoses journal. The original study focused on exploring the transcriptomic alterations in innate immune cells in patients with CAPM, identifying key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathways implicated in the disease. Our replication effort aims to validate these findings and extend the understanding of the immune dysfunction and molecular pathways involved in CAPM.
